## Aim
To group RV camps by neighboring facilities in order for RV campers to discover their own preferences and find other similar camp grounds that they would like to stay at in North America.

## Background
With the current economic downturn many people are looking for ways to save money. One of those ways is to live in an RV (Recreational Vehicle) which is in essence a [house on wheels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_vehicle).  This cuts down on mortgage and rent costs dramatically allowing many people to save and spend their money where they would like to instead.

Many RVers regardless of whether they stay in one location most the time or travel consistently require extensive research of camp sites before they move in order to plan their stays. Information such as costs and locations are available online, but there is no grouping of sites into similar types. Some users would for instance prefer sites with grocery stores, or many restaurants close by, while others might prefer to stay away from population centers and away from the main roads.

This project will look into helping RVers in general cut down their research time with planning routes and stays as well as make their experiences as comfortable as possible through allowing them access to the machine learning model this project will generate.

## Tools to be used in this project

 - Foursquare API for venue locations and specifications
 - General web resourcefulness for retrieving camp site data
 - Scikit-learn for model development
 - SQL for storing data
 - Folium for visualizing data
 - Pandas and NumPy for their various data structures and methodologies
