## Aim
To group RV camps sites by neighboring facilities in order for RVers to discover their own preferences and find other similar camp sites that they would like to stay at in North America.

## Background
With the current economic downturn many people are looking for ways to save money. One of those ways is to live in an RV (Recreational Vehicle) which is in essence a [house on wheels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_vehicle).  This cuts down on mortgage and rent costs dramatically allowing many people to save and spend their money where they would like to instead. Living in an RV allows many to enjoy traveling, working from home and spend more quality time with their families.

RVers have to plan their camp site stays tregardless of whether they stay in one location most the time or travel consistently. Information such as costs and locations are available online, but there is no grouping of camp sites into similar types. Some users would for instance prefer sites with grocery stores, or many restaurants close by, while others might prefer to stay away from towns and cities. We will be looking at over 200 types of such neighboring facilities in this study.

This project will look into helping RVers in general cut down their research time with planning routes and stays as well as make their experiences as comfortable as possible through allowing them access to the machine learning model this project will generate.

## Tools to be used in this project

 - Foursquare API for venue locations and specifications
 - General web resourcefulness for retrieving camp site data
 - Scikit-learn for model development
 - SQL for storing data
 - Folium for visualizing data
 - Pandas and NumPy for their various data structures and methodologies
